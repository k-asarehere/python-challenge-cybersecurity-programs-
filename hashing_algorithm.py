"""a py script that hashes a user file document.
Use Case: When you have a document file and you want to know whether it has been modified or not,
you first have to hash the document(using this program) and after that keep the hash values(64 fixed-size string characters) somewhere. Then, as time goes on or 
when you get suspicion that the document file has lost it's integrity(been modified), you again run it through this program. When the hash values are different(from the previous hash values you kept somewhere) it means the document file has indeed 
been modified and has lost it's integrity(someone might have change some values).....,"""
